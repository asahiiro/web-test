                <p>As the morning sunlight shone through the windows of the bedroom, an electronic alarm clock buzzed, waking a slumbering young man.</p>

                <p>Oliver groaned as he reached across the bedside table and hit the stop button before dragging his hand down his face and yawning loudly, stretching his body out beneath the covers.</p>
                    
                <p>His black hair was messy from a night's rest, and his chocolate brown eyes squinted at the sun coming through his curtains.</p>
                    
                <p>"Ahhhh... damn it..." He laid his head back against his soft pillow and closed his eyes, not wanting to wake up. It took several long minutes before he managed to get out of bed.</p>
                    
                <p>taking a quick shower and getting dressed, Oliver headed downstairs, finding his mom, Mia, in the living room doing her daily yoga routine.</p>
                    
                <p>She was wearing tight-fitting workout attire consisting of a red sports bra, revealing a good amount of cleavage and midriff, as well as black yoga pants that hugged her big booty and left little to the imagination.</p>
                    
                <p>Mia had long, black hair that reached her shoulders. The majority of it was pulled into a ponytail, with some strands falling to frame her pretty face.</p>
                    
                <p>When she noticed her son watching, her blue eyes locked with Oliver's, and she smiled at him.</p>
                    
                <p>"Morning, sweetie. How'd you sleep?" She asked as she bent over in the cow pose, exposing her huge chest while looking up at him.</p>
