                            <p>As the morning sunlight shone through the windows of the bedroom, an electronic alarm clock buzzed, waking a slumbering young man.</p>
                            <p>Oliver groaned as he reached across the bedside table and hit the stop button before dragging his hand down his face and yawning loudly, stretching his body out beneath the covers.</p>
                            <p>His black hair was messy from a night's rest, and his chocolate brown eyes squinted at the sun coming through his curtains.</p>
                            <p>"Ahhhh... damn it..." He laid his head back against his soft pillow and closed his eyes, not wanting to wake up. It took several long minutes before he managed to get out of bed.</p>
                            <p>taking a quick shower and getting dressed, Oliver headed downstairs, finding his mom, Mia, in the living room doing her daily yoga routine.</p>
                            <p>She was wearing tight-fitting workout attire consisting of a red sports bra, revealing a good amount of cleavage and midriff, as well as black yoga pants that hugged her big booty and left little to the imagination.</p>
                            <p>Mia had long, black hair that reached her shoulders. The majority of it was pulled into a ponytail, with some strands falling to frame her pretty face.</p>
                            <p>When she noticed her son watching, her blue eyes locked with Oliver's, and she smiled at him.</p>
                            <p>"Morning, sweetie. How'd you sleep?" She asked as she bent over in the cow pose, exposing her huge chest while looking up at him.</p>
                            <p>"Uh...good."</p>
                            <p>"I'm glad to hear that."</p>
                            <p>Oliver could feel his cheeks heating up at how sexy his mom looked as he watched her move into the downward dog pose, arching her back and putting her voluptuous behind up in the air.</p>
                            <p>He wasn't sure if it was normal to be aroused by seeing your own mother's private areas like that, but he tried not to think about it too much. He never had any experience with girls before because he was always scared to even talk to them, never mind date one.</p>
                            <p>This made him quite awkward around other people, especially girls, and often caused him to become uncomfortable when they would talk to him. It was very hard to strike up a conversation with someone when you couldn't even look them in the eye.</p>
                            <p>Besides being shy, Oliver was a very nervous person who often got flustered over simple things and panicked whenever he was put on the spot.</p>
                            <p>So instead, he decided to just try not to look at his mom's skintight outfit as she continued doing her yoga.</p>
                            <p>"Ollie, the breakfast is ready. Come eat it before it gets cold," his father Adam said as he was sipping on his coffee at the dining table and reading through the morning newspaper.</p>
                            <p>Oliver then went to the kitchen and sat down at the table. His dad handed him a plate filled with pancakes and bacon, and he began to eat without saying anything else.</p>
                            <p>"So, Ollie, are you ready for our trip today?" Adam asked.</p>
                            <p>"U-Um...yeah."</p>
                            <p>"Did you pack your things like I told you to last night?"</p>
                            <p>"Y-Yes...why?"</p>
                            <p>"Good. Because we're leaving right after breakfast!"</p>
                            <p>"Huh? Already?"</p>
                            <p>"Yes! Your mom booked us an earlier flight so we don't have to sit around at the airport all day. This will be our first time going to a beach resort in a long time, and I can't wait! Can you?"</p>
                            <p>"Uhh..."</p>
                            <p>"Come on, cheer up! I know you don't really like traveling and stuff like that, but I promise you will enjoy yourself when we get there. You get to see the ocean and all kinds of beautiful sights. Not to mention, we can spend some quality time together as a family."</p>
                            <p>"Okay... just... promise not to make me play any stupid games with you two again..."</p>
                            <p>Just when Oliver finished his sentence, Mia walked into the kitchen. She stopped behind her son, put her hands around his neck, and held him tight, giving him a kiss on the cheek.</p>
                            <p>"What are you talking about? There are many games we could play on this trip, and they will all be fun and not stupid," she said, purring into his ear.                            </p>
                            <p>Oliver blushed when he felt his mother's massive bust pressing against his back, and his dad chuckled at how embarrassed his son got whenever Mia hugged him.</p>
                            <p>"Mom, p-please stop hugging me like that. I'm trying to eat my breakfast."</p>
                            <p>"But I like hugging you. You are my baby, after all." She cooed as she kept her arms wrapped around her son's chest.</p>
                            <p>"M-Mom! Please... Don't say embarrassing stuff like that."</p>
                            <p>"But there is nothing embarrassing about a mother loving her son. I love you, Ollie," she whispered into his ear before licking it teasingly.</p>
                            <p>"Mom!"</p>
                            <p>The sound of Adam laughing echoed throughout the room, causing Oliver to get even more flustered. "You're so adorable, son. Just the way your mom always describes you," he teased, making Oliver turn bright red.</p>
                            <p>"Not only adorable, but handsome too. Isn't that right, honey?" Mia asked.</p>
                            <p>Adam smirked and nodded in agreement. "Of course. After all, I do have quite charming looks; wouldn't you agree, Mia?"</p>

                            <p>"Maybe. However, Ollie got his good looks from me," she giggled.</p>

                            <p>"Umm...I think I'm done eating now..." Oliver muttered, pushing his plate away. "I'm going to go upstairs and grab my backpack."</p>

                            <p>Mia grinned and let go of Oliver as he stood up and walked away without turning back, his cheeks still flushed pink.</p>

                            <p>She then turned to face her husband and said, "It looks like we made our little boy feel embarrassed by giving him too much love, Adam."</p>

                            <p>Adam snorted and shook his head. "You know how he gets. Poor guy doesn't have the ability to deal with much affection without getting flustered."</p>

                            <p>"True. I hope this trip will help him become more confident. Being shy is fine and all, but he's not even able to talk to his own friends because he's so afraid. That's not healthy for a young boy like him. We should encourage him to try new things and experience the world around him."</p>

                            <p>"Well, we can start with this beach trip. Maybe he'll open up more when we're surrounded by new environments."</p>

                            <p>"Exactly!"</p>

                            <p>"Alright. Finish getting ready so we can leave as soon as possible." Adam smiled and stood up to carry his empty plate to the sink.</p>

                            <p>"Okay," Mia said, smiling at her husband.</p>
